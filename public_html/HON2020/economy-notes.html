                <li> production - something with technology? resources associated with humans (!); capital and <b> entrepreneurship </b></li>
                <li> land - minimal production from land (look at iron islands); changes the culture and how they operate; very urban with little
                    resources; all resources must be imported; political power is keeping them there? have to justify why they're able to stay there
                    with no resources; 
                </li>
                <li> labor - how people contribute to the production; specialized labor population - everyone is an expert in something (specialize in 
                    school as children - kids are put into school immediately); some people are "experts in raising the children" - that's what they
                    learn about and specialize in the school; old people look at <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Spartans-after-they-grew-too-old-to-fight">

                </li>
                <li> capital - tools available for production; production center instead of resources (import the resources and export the products); look
                    at maybe using magic to improve capital in the city?
                </li>
                <li> entrepreneurship - combining land, labor, and capital in innovative ways; must have a certain standard of living (we do) meaning we 
                    have a plethora of entrepreneurship
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>consumption - have three needs (food, clothing, and shelter - how do they get these three things); technological reason for not giving one 
                    of those things?
                </li>
            </ol>
