      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a production sense, the Hidden Isle has little to no production made out of the land. Due to its status
      as a very urban city center, there are little to no resources - thus most of their resources must be imported. They are able to stay
      this way due to the impact their hidden location has on their political power throughout the world, allowing them to acquire resources
      by visiting other areas of the world rather than having the goods brought to them. As mentioned in the geography build, their discovery
      of steam engine technology allows them to be incredibly efficient when importing goods without having to reveal their location The economy of the
      Hidden Isle is based strongly around their production of goods and using their superior technology to and specialized labor to
      create goods for the rest of the world. The basis of this superior technology comes from their in depth knowledge of the sciences
      found throughout the world, as explained in the history build. Additionally, the entrance of kids into school at their birth leads
      to an economy where everyone is an expert in something, decided at a young age based on their skills and talents. As people age,
      society treats them similar to the elders in the Ancient Greek city of Sparta, where they retire and live in the city but are
      allowed to run for council positions to work with those selected to rule the government through the school system. These retirees are
      also the center of entrepreneurship in the city, as once they have filled the obligation of their specialization they can pursue 
      whatever they want through the use of their capital and labor.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to its lack of natural resources, the Hidden Isle imports all of the food that it consumes. With their adoption
      of steam engines, however, they are able to have a constant influx of food, so there are never any shortages or crises regarding food. Most
      of their clothing is developed in the city through specialists, but there is also clothing that has been imported. Shelter is found through
      the professional system, where people in the same specialty all live in houses together since there is no concept of family.
