            <li>change - a flood happened a long time ago and so they adapted and created flood walls (similar to what they did in NYC after hurricane sandy) so that they aren't affected by floods anymore</li>
            <li>genealogy - doesn't matter. children are all sent to live, grow up, and learn together without the idea of family. the best children are then chosen as successors for the leadership positions in the government</li>
            <li>history - written records of everything</li>
        </ul>
