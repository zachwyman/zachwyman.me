                <li>patterns of behavior - repeated behaviors, things that keep happening</li>
                <li>explicit culture - language spoken, values, beliefs, clothes you wear
                    <br>implicit culture - what you don't think about; dispositions, responses to external stimuli
                    ; based off of something that you don't even know
                </li>
                <li>culture - like glasses, filter what you see and change your perspective; when do you get married, when do you have children,
                    when do you eat
                </li>
                <li>if there's a documented history, then they value written fact and that affects the rest of their culture</li>
                <li> religion about worshipping the settlers? something like the ten commandments created by the original settlers or a declaration of
                    independence type document
                </li>
