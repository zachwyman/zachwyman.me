            <ul>
                <li>patterns of behavior - repeated behaviors, things that keep happening</li>
                <li>explicit culture - language spoken, values, beliefs, clothes you wear
                    <br>implicit culture - what you don't think about; dispositions, responses to external stimuli
                    ; based off of something that you don't even know
                </li>
                <li>culture - like glasses, filter what you see and change your perspective; when do you get married, when do you have children,
                    when do you eat
                </li>
                <li>if there's a documented history, then they value written fact and that affects the rest of their culture</li>
                <li> religion about worshipping the settlers? something like the ten commandments created by the original settlers or a declaration of
                    independence type document
                </li>
                <li> how is the shelter made? why does it have certain structures? walls (don't have walls because nobody knows where we are)?
                     types of houses? meaning of the shelter vs. the functionality of it</li>
                <li>when using money as a medium, where did that come from? why did they do that? why create a middle step? specialization!!!</li>
                <li> technology - tools to get food (trade? sea?) </li>
            </ul>
