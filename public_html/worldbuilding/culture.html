      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social structure of the Hidden Isle is centered around the professional bodies and the professional group that
      each person belongs to. This is engrained into the population through the education system at a young age, where people follow certain
      educational tracks established by their skills, which in turn leads into their professions. This social structure is then cemented in their
      shelter, as the population lives in houses with people that work with them in their profession. In the education system, the young learn 
      how their roles in society work by observing their mentors and the professionals in the fields that they are going to be entering. These 
      interactions create a regimented professional culture, where everyone understands the future of their professional career and what they can 
      expect from their career at a very young age. For recreation, the population has complete control over the use of their leisure time,
      creating a strong dynamic shift between their rigid professional lives and independent personal lives. The unrestricted personal lives leads 
      to an abundance of entrepreneurship, which is then amplified after retirement when the time commitment of the professional life disappears.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of economy, the use of a currency facilitates the specialized professional system, where segments of 
      the population can become experts in a trade, and in turn can profit off of that trade to afford the remaining necessities for a comfortable life. 
      The specialized nature of society also creates a professional pride amongst the population, and reinforces the core of the social structure centering
      around the professional bodies in the city. Additionally, the emphasis on productivity and advancement in society fosters a passion surrounding
      technology and an appreciation for the impact that it has on society.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of the Hidden Isle is compromised of a combination of a council of elders elected by their peers and a 
      select group of citizens that are selected to work in the government through the education system. The government rules based on the writings 
      of a document called the <i>Issuance Doctrine</i>, which was created by the settlers of the Hidden Isle and has been the ruling document since
      the colonization of the island. <i>(Note: History build must be updated to reflect the Issuance Doctrine).</i> This document states that the 
      city was founded "to create a prosperous society where technological advancement is treasured, and push civilization to the edge of forward 
      progress." This document has also created a religious-like following in society, where the population values progress and advancement. These 
      values have led to the increased productivity of the population, and has allowed their economy to prosper as a capital and entrepreneurship
      based economy.
