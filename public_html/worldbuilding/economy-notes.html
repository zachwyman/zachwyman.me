            <ul>
                <li> production - something with technology? resources associated with humans (!); capital and <b> entrepreneurship </b></li>
                <li> land - minimal production from land (look at iron islands); changes the culture and how they operate; very urban with little
                    resources; all resources must be imported; political power is keeping them there? have to justify why they're able to stay there
                    with no resources; 
                </li>
                <li> labor - how people contribute to the production; specialized labor population - everyone is an expert in something (specialize in 
                    school as children - kids are put into school immediately); some people are "experts in raising the children" - that's what they
                    learn about and specialize in the school; old people look at <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-Spartans-after-they-grew-too-old-to-fight"> 
                    sparta </a>
                </li>
                <li> capital - tools available for production; production center instead of resources (import the resources and export the products); look
                    at maybe using magic to improve capital in the city?
                </li>
                <li> entrepreneurship - combining land, labor, and capital in innovative ways; must have a certain standard of living (we do) meaning we 
                    have a plethora of entrepreneurship
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>consumption - have three needs (food, clothing, and shelter - how do they get these three things); technological reason for not giving one 
                    of those things? are there any major wants for the population (culture, psycology, government)? shelter - houses for the professions
                </li>
                <li>supply and demand - surplus of goods? anything that's always in demand? what does that mean?</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <ul><li>distribution - command economy where the government sets the rules (sending the kids to school; deciding what they specialize in; benefit of being
                a command economy where there's no unemployment because everyone is given a specialty); people are given freedom in their personal life but their
                professional life is controlled by the government;
                </li>
                <li>currency - do we have currency? should definitely have a currency (is it the physical thing or the meaning behind it?)
                    use a central banking system separate from the iron bank (debt? is there a 
                    sense of loaning? can people go into debt?)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br><br><br>
            note about traveling fast - technologically discovered steam engines (makes them super efficient in production and distribution)
