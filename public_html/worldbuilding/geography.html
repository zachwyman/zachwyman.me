    <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea behind my build, The Hidden Isle, is to create a neutral city-state that facilitates all other kingdoms and dynasties throughout the realm in an attempt to keep world peace. Similar concepts include the United Nations (an agency that works with world countries to keep international peace), the conspiracies of the illuminati (a secret society that manipulates and controls world events), the Vatican City (the city-state that governs the Catholic Church), the man behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz, and the Elysian Fields (a secret society in House of Cards where the world's most powerful men gather). Because of that, the location of The Hidden Isle is unknown to common people, and practically everyone in the world. The only people that know the location of the island are those that inhabit it and govern the city-state.
       The fixed location of the Hidden Isle is west of the Summer Isles in the Sunset Sea. The Sunset Sea is a vast, unexplored ocean where nothing has been found by explorers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative location to the rest of the world allows the Hidden Isle to operate in secrecy, without the fear of invasion, attack, or outside pressure from other entities.
Politically, this helps them facilitate peacemaking between nations by letting them host world leaders without the possibility of any threats on their lives.
Their strong role in world politics also allows them to amass great wealth, giving them the opportunity to trade on their own terms and seek out their necessities rather than depending on traders to visit them. 
Culturally, this has led to a very organized and structured society, where all decisions are made for the benefit of the world and not out of personal gain or greed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landform of the entire city-state is an island with minimal terrain, allowing the city-state to expand into a busy metropolis. 
The climate is hot and Mediterranean, similar to that of the Summer Isles.
There is minimal farmable soil, as almost all of the island has been taken up by the city-state that rules.
The most significant case of flora and fauna is a reef that surrounds the island, which converts salt water to fresh water. This is the source of all the water that the population uses.
Their situation as an island surrounded by water allows them to remain isolated and control the politics of the modern world from afar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to the Vatican City, the population of the Hidden Isle is very small, but due to it's tiny area it ranks near the top of the world in terms of population density.
The growth rate is negligible, as children are born out of necessity rather than recreation.
The entire population lives inside the city-state and consists of the government, scholars, and experts of a variety of different crafts. 
The Hidden Isle works together as a collective unit, so there are no regions in the city-state.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is an island in the middle of the Sunset Sea, no physical movement affects the Hidden Isle.
However, since it's location is unknown, all movement in and out of the Hidden Isle is done by its inhabitants. 
These movements allow them to control everything that comes in and out of the city-state, including trade, beliefs, and knowledge.
All of this movement is done out of necessity, whether it is bringing food to the island, news about what is happening throughout the rest of the world, or knowledge on the updates of science and technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of the Hidden Isle has used their immense world power to learn of all technology and science throughout the world that is not highly guarded or secretive (like wildfire).
The respectful culture of the Hidden Isle has helped to prevent problems caused by their use of technology.
There are no environmental hazards due to the entire island being taken up by the city-state.
The size of the island is the prime limiting factor for human habitation in the Hidden Island.

<i>One addition to this build is that they are able to travel across the world quickly and efficiently due to a system of magical caves that provide access to
  locations all throughout the world. The discovery of these caves led to the colonization of the Hidden Isle, but the location of the caves has been a closely
  guarded secret to ensure the privacy of the Hidden Isle.
