      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most interesting aspects of the Hidden Isle is their interactions with the world at large. Most of the interactions
      are done through Wanderers, whose profession it is to meet other civilizations and trade with them, advancing both communities. That being said, the Hidden
      Isle also interacts with the rest of the world in a "man behind the curtain" type of fashion, as discussed in some of the earlier builds. They also do this
      through the Wanderers, who act as diplomats for their specific regions. This diplomatic responsibility can range from lobbying with leaders to learning about 
      the events going on in different areas throughout the world. While events throughout the world rarely have direct impacts on the civilization of the Hidden 
      Isle, they will often have an impact on their development due to the reliance on interactions with other civilizations for advancement
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the possible negative consequences of making more global connections with the world is the discovery of the route to get to
      the Hidden Isle. One of their biggest kept secrets is the locations of the entrances to the Cave System that accesses the Hidden Isle, and the more that Wanderers
      interact with other civilizations increases the chances that these entrances are found. The balance between local needs and global connections is not a problem,
      the two are almost entirely split through their professional groups.
