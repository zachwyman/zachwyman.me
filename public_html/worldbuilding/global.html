      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most interesting aspects of the Hidden Isle is their interactions with the world at large. Most of the interactions
      are done through Wanderers, whose profession it is to meet other civilizations and trade with them, advancing both communities. That being said, the Hidden
      Isle also interacts with the rest of the world in a "man behind the curtain" type of fashion, as discussed in some of the earlier builds.
