      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government of the Hidden Isle works as a combination of three different government types - a Gerontocracy, a Meritocracy,
      and a Syndicracy. The judicial branch of the government is a Gerontocracy, where it is built up by a council of elders. This is discussed in the economy
      and culture builds, where individuals can run to join a council of elders that helps run the government after retirement. The remainder of the government
      is made up of two different legislative bodies that work together. One of these bodies is a meritocracy, where people are selected to work in the government
      and educated accordingly as part of the schooling system when they are younger. The other body is a syndicracy, which is ruled by the leaders of the differing
      professional bodies. The selection of these leaders differs from body to body, where some professional bodies hold elections, some are meritocracies, and
      others may follow a chiefdom with the oldest professional ruling the body. All law enforcement is done through a profession, where individuals are selected
      to be a part of the law enforcement profession through the education system.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power and respect are earned through success in one's profession, as society is structured through the system of professional bodies.
      Similarly, people can gain influence through discovering new technological advances and pushing their profession forward due to the society's huge emphasis
      on advancement. In the syndicracy, power can be gained in differing ways depending on how the professional body is set up. There are fairly few opportunities
      for gaining influence outside of one's professional body because of the strict structure of society, but in general power is acquired through meritocratic
      based on the values of the population of the Hidden Isle. Practically all decision makers are part of the government, due to the bicameral and syndicratic
      elements of the government.
