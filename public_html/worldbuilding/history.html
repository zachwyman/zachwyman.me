      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Hidden Isle, time is kept in written records similar to the way that time is kept at the Citadel.
      Due to their historical influence on world politics, the maesters in the Hidden Isle have written records surrounding most of the 
      historic events, and similarly catalogue all major events in the world as they occur. All of these written records are stored in a
      library similar to the ancient Library of Alexandria, which stored texts on everything and anything in the world. This allows the 
      government of the Hidden Isle to make informed decisions when "pulling the strings" based on past experiences and events. All of 
      this history is written by traveling maesters, who travel across the world to learn information and bring it back to the main 
      libraries at the Hidden Isle.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wealth of knowledge has a large impact on the society of the Hidden Isle and the executive decisions that
      are made in order to ensure the Hidden Isle keeps the power it has in world politics. One example of the impact that this knowledge has 
      is hundreds of years ago, when a giant tsunami hit the Hidden Isle and ravaged the outer areas of the city. From this natural disaster,
      the government made a point to surround the city with flood walls so that they could never be affected by a similar disaster again.
      Another example of their past influencing their current status comes from an explorer who found the Hidden Isle hundreds of years ago
      and held their location ransom, threatening to reveal it to the rest of the world if they didn't pay him very handsomely. Since then,
      the Hidden Isle has been very strict about keeping its location unknown, and sends out patrols to ensure that no one leaves the Sunset
      Sea knowing their location.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards to genealogy, family lineage does not matter in the Hidden Isle. As noted in the Geography Build,
      the growth rate is negligible in the Hidden Isle, and children are borne out of necessity rather than recreation. Once a child is born,
      they are brought to a boarding development school, where they grow up, live, and learn with all other children their age in the city-state.
      The children are then evaluated as they age on put on specialist paths, with the best children being raised to be successors in the
      leadership positions in the government. This ensures that no children are given an unfair advantage, and the best are allowed to prosper
      and take control as leaders in the city-state. By having a performance driven society, the Hidden Isle is able to keep their world power 
      and continuously prosper throughout history.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important document in the history of the Hidden Isle is a document called the <i>Issuance Doctrine</i>,
      which is a document that was created by the settlers of the island when they founded the city now known as the Hidden Isle. The <i>Issuance 
      Doctrine</i> explains the purpose of the creation of the Hidden Isle and the necessity that civilization had for the founding of a city like 
      the Hidden Isle. Real world comparisons of the <i>Issuance Doctrine</i> include documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the 
      Ten Commandments. The most recognized line of the <i>Issuance Doctrine</i> states that the city of the Hidden Isle was founded "to create a 
      prosperous society where technological advancement is treasured, and push civilization to the edge of forward progress," and this line has 
      become a standard that citizens of the Hidden Isle hold themselves and their society to.
