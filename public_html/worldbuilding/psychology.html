      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main biopyschosocial factors that influence identity among the population of the Hidden Isle. First off, the seclusion of the Hidden
      Isle from the rest of the world has a large impact on the identity of the people of the Hidden Isle. While there are groups that leave the Hidden Isle and travel, the majority
      of society never leaves the Hidden Isle and spends their entire lives on the island. This would be both psychological effect, as people in the population may feel trapped
      or anxious about what else is in the world. The other factor that influences the identity of the people that live on the Hidden Isle is the labor system, where the population 
      is separated into groups based on their profession. These are the people that they live with and spend all of their working hours with, so it is natural that the people would
      create an identity and social stigma surrounding their profession. While people's biological sex is important for procreation, there are no genders on the Hidden Isle due to 
      the living professional structure of the population. Everyone is raised in the education the same, and people are separated by their skills and talents rather than their 
      biological sex. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CT McCor is a healthy 14 year old kid training to be a Wanderer. He has been a part of the Wanderer career track since his seventh year of schooling, when 
      he was eleven years old. He was chosen for the Wanderer track due to his superior intellectual ability, as he was always in the top percentiles of the academic school sessions.
      He also typically performed well in his athletic education sessions, but never was athletic enough to be placed in a professional track based on his abilities. Training to be
      a Wanderer is the dream of many children, as they often look up to them when they start their education; thus, CT has a strong peer group and is of what could be considered 
      "elite" social status. Because of this elite social status, he has very high self-esteem and a very outgoing personality. As a trainee in the Wanderer career path, he will 
      eventually get to choose a region which he works in and interacts with. This affects him when building relationships, as he has no idea where he will be working in the next 
      five years.
