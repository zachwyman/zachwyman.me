     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the emphasis on technological advancement in the society of the Hidden Isle, technology has had a large impact on the people
     that live on the Hidden Isle. A lot of the technology used is part of the typical day-to-day life to make their professional lives more efficient, as the main 
     focus of society is on the professional system. Additionally, people use technology to learn about the world outside of the Hidden Isle. This can be seen in
     the Wanderers, whose sole job is to explore the world and acquire technology from different civilizations. Due to these circumstances, science is much less of 
     a focus in society. The role of science mostly exists in the education system, to teach the population about the world and how it works, but there are few 
     professionals dedicated to studying science. This is because much of technology is acquired through external communications, so there is little necessity for 
     internal scientific growth.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic particularly has made the colonization of the Hidden Isle possible. This can be seen in two different elements, the reef surrounding
     the island and the cave system that connects the island to the rest of the world. The reef surrounding the island makes it livable, as it is the only source of fresh 
     water for the inhabitants of the island. The reef has a magical property that converts the water that flows through it from salt water to fresh water, providing 
     drinkable water for the population. The cave system provides transportation from the Hidden Isle to the rest of the world. This allows the Wanderers to quickly reach
     their territory without having to spend months sailing at sea. Additionally, this allows for the Wanderers to quickly transport goods and technology without the worry
     of losing them through a long and hard journey.

     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the necessity of the reef, it is stricly against the law to interact with the reef, and this is policed heavily by the professionals that
     are trained in the law enforcement profession. Similarly, there are strict restrictions that are placed on the cave system, as it is the lifeline between the Hidden Isle 
     and the rest of the world. Because of the huge emphasis on technology on the <i>Issuance Doctrine</i>, many citizens look at it as their duty to advance 
     technology and use it to its fullest capabilities. The use of technology has not affected the environment surrounding the Hidden Isle significantly due to the regulations
     placed surrounding the cave and reef system.
