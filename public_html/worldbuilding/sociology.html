      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the social institutions that individuals in society regularly interact with is the Enlightened, the governmental institution that controls the education 
      system in the Hidden Isle. The Enlightened run the school system for children of all ages, and are responsible for deciding the professions for students while they're studying. Individuals 
      interact with the Enlightened outside of school as well, where any scientific or technological achievements are brought to them as a part of a bounty system sponsored by the government, in 
      an attempt to incentivize advancement in society. Conflict with the Enlightened is rare, as it typically does not make logical sense to not cooperate with them. When people refuse to cooperate
      with the Enlightened, it usually results in social shunning and shame in their profession. This is because the Enlightened are responsible for the education of everyone on the Hidden Isle,
      meaning that they had a direct impact on everyone's success and development. There are no institutions with differing values or norms from the Enlightened, as they are instrumental in the
      lives of the entire population from an early age.  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another social institution that affects society at the macro level is the Wanderers. The Wanderers is a profession in the Hidden Isle that is tasked with exploring
      the world and interacting with other societies. They are trained from an early age in both technology and diplomacy, and are the main contact between the Hidden Isle and the outside world.
      Their main function in society is to trade technologies with the other lands that they meet. Each group of Wanderers is given a certain territory, where they become experts in that territories
      culture, technology, and politics. From these relationships, they are able to strategically trade technologies with their assigned civilizations, spreading technological advancement throughout
      the world while still ensuring that the Hidden Isle retains its technological advantages. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the institutions in the Hidden Isle are segregated by profession, as seen by the Enlightened and the Wanderers. This can further be seen in the living situation
      of the population, where everyone lives in houses with the other people in their profession. Due to the segregation of people by profession, race has no effect on society. In a similar vein, the 
      secluded nature of the Hidden Isle causes the entire population of the city to be of the same ethnic origins, meaning that ethnicity does not play a role in society either.
